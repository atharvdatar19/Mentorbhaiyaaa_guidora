# Mentor Bhaiyaaa – Opportunity Visibility Platform

## 🚀 Innovit Phase 2 Submission

Mentor Bhaiyaaa is a structured opportunity visibility platform built to solve information asymmetry faced by students from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. 

Many students miss lateral entries, spot rounds, CUET-based admissions, and state-level opportunities simply because the information is scattered across newspapers, regional portals, and university websites.

We centralize those opportunities and highlight deadlines so no student misses out again.
